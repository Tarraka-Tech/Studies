# Studies
Hello, in here you can find the first two projects that i made during the first module.
Blog-Kenzie (HTML and CSS) was the first project i worked on without prior knowledge of HTML and CSS.
Interface - KenzieFlix was the second project i worked. Its the final project of the HTML and CSS from this module.
Atm im starting the second module of this course, Java Scrip, so in the future i hope to post even more of my projects here.
Pls feel free to add any comments or observations about both projects.
